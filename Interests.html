        <ol class="links">
          <li><a href="https://www.taylorswift.com/ " target="_blank">Taylor Swift</a>. I grew up listening to TS and have so much fun listening to her music. Some of it takes me back to certain times in my life and I think it’s awesome that music holds memories for me. </li>
          <li><a href="https://tasteottawa.com/restaurant-directory/" target="_blank">Restaurants</a>. Ottawa has an absolutely fantastic restaurant scene. One thing I do when I find a new restaurant to try is I always read through the entire menu. I don’t really drink anymore so it’s really nice to see menus with non-alcoholic options that are just as fun as regular cocktails. </li>
          <li><a href=" https://www.littlemissottawa.com/road-trips-from-ottawa/" target="_blank">Day trips</a>. The city is in prime location for day trips. Even overnight trips to Montreal or Toronto are an option. It’s fun planning a hike or to go someplace I’ve never been to that’s at least an hour away. I try to go somewhere new since I haven’t seen a ton of Ontario yet. </li>
          <li>Chill days. Sometimes I’ll bike to Mooney’s Bay and read my book. Friends and I will go for walks and grab an ice cream or coffee, which is a nice alternative to going out for drinks. If I’m in the middle of a good book, I’ll sit out on my balcony and relax. During the winter I tend to hibernate so I really have to force myself to get outside for a walk.  </li>
