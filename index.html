    <h2>A little about me</h2> 
      <p>My name is Christina, but to my friends I go by C or Tina. Family members call me by my full name or Chrissy. I never gave much thought to my name until I started being exposed to people outside of my immediate circle. Sure, I had one friend that called me Tina in high school, but I never thought about it until one employer looked at me and said, “We need a shorter name for you.” He settled on C.K. Another employer simply did not want to write my entire name out on daily tasks so he dubbed me Tina. One friend started calling me C and hasn’t stopped in the three years we’ve been friends. My mother knew a Tina and she couldn’t stand her so I had to warn my boyfriend not to call me Tina when she was around to avoid the conversation.</p>

       <p>“I'm just going to spell my last name for you,” I would say to every person ever who asked for my information. Growing up in New Brunswick I wasn’t exposed to a lot of ethnicities, so my last name always felt like a weight. When I was a little girl, I just wanted a 4-letter last name. Don’t get me wrong, it was so cool having Korotkov be my last name, but trying to spell my name in kindergarten had me in tears some days.</p>

        <p class="lately">I have been trying to learn more about my birth chart. My sun is in Capricorn, my ascendent is Capricorn, and my moon is Cancer. From what I've gathered, the sun represents the identity, ascendent is is my social personality, and moon is the soul behind the identity. This implies that Capricorns are motivated by material needs. They a hard workers and are practical. They are excellent at staying grounded during stressful times. However, because my moon is Cancer, this means I am sensitive to change and react emotionally.</p>
